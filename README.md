A full-fledged plugin compatible with Elementor to add unique animations to containers, elements, and widgets, with hover and scroll-triggered animations.

## Description

Animatrix for Elementor extends the capabilities of the Elementor page builder by providing a rich set of unique, attention-grabbing animations. Unlike Elementor's default animations, Animatrix offers a fresh library of effects that can be applied to any element, container, or widget on your page.

With intuitive controls integrated directly into Elementor's "Advanced" tab, you can easily add complex animations without writing a single line of code.

### Features:

- **Over 30 Unique Animations:** A large selection of high-quality animations powered by Animate.css.
- **Animation Triggers:**
  - **On Load:** The animation plays as soon as the element enters the viewport.
  - **On Hover:** The animation is triggered when a user hovers their mouse over the element.
  - **On Scroll:** The animation plays when the user scrolls the element into view.
- **Full Control:** Customize the animation duration, delay, and iteration count to perfectly match your design.
- **Seamless Integration:** Controls are conveniently located in the "Advanced" tab for any Elementor element under the "Animatrix" section.
